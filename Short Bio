Hi. I'm Mikaela G. Santos. My friends call me Mikee for short.
I am a 20-year-old 2nd Year Electronics Engineering Student from University of Santo Tomas. 
My hometown is Imus, Cavite.  
I have a wide range of interests such as movies, technology, music, food, education, and gaming.

My dream is to work in the aviation field someday. :)
