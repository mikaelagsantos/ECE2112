I am a 20-year-old 2nd Year Electronics Engineering Student from University of Santo Tomas. 
I am from section 2ECE-A.
My hometown is Imus, Cavite.  
I have a wide range of interests such as movies, technology, music, food, education, and gaming.

I love my program, BS ECE. I believe that I can be good at it someday.
